abstractNote = {The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Building Technologies Program has set the aggressive goal of producing marketable net-zero energy buildings by 2025. This goal will require collaboration between the DOE laboratories and the building industry. We developed standard or reference energy models for the most common commercial buildings to serve as starting points for energy efficiency research. These models represent fairly realistic buildings and typical construction practices. Fifteen commercial building types and one multifamily residential building were determined by consensus between DOE, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and represent approximately two-thirds of the commercial building stock.},

abstractNote = {High-performance buildings require an integrated design approach for all systems to work together optimally; systems integration needs to be incorporated in the earliest stages of design for efforts to be cost and energy-use effective. Building designers need a full-featured software framework to support rigorous, multidisciplinary building simulation. An open source framework - the OpenStudioSoftware Development Kit (SDK) - is being developed to address this need. In this paper, we discuss the needs that drive OpenStudio's system architecture and goals, provide a development status report (the SDK is currently in alpha release), and present a brief case study that illustrates its utility and flexibility.},

abstract = "The OpenStudio software development kit has played a significant role in the adoption of the EnergyPlus whole building energy modeling engine and in the development and launch of new applications that use EnergyPlus for a variety of purposes, from design to auditing to code compliance and management of large portfolios. One of the most powerful features of the OpenStudio platform is Measure, a scripting facility similar to Excel's Visual Basic macros. Measures can be used to apply energy conservation measures to models—hence the name—to create reports and visualizations, and even to sew together custom workflows. Measures automate tedious tasks increasing modeler productivity and reducing error. Measures have also become a currency in the OpenStudio tools ecosystem, a way to codify knowledge and protocol and transfer it from one modeler to another, either within an organization or within the global modeling community. This paper describes some of the many applications of Measures."

abstract = "Many of the popular building energy simulation programs around the world are reaching maturity — some use simulation methods (and even code) that originated in the 1960s. For more than two decades, the US government supported development of two hourly building energy simulation programs, BLAST and DOE-2. Designed in the days of mainframe computers, expanding their capabilities further has become difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. At the same time, the 30 years have seen significant advances in analysis and computational methods and power — providing an opportunity for significant improvement in these tools. In 1996, a US federal agency began developing a new building energy simulation tool, EnergyPlus, building on development experience with two existing programs: DOE-2 and BLAST. EnergyPlus includes a number of innovative simulation features — such as variable time steps, user-configurable modular systems that are integrated with a heat and mass balance-based zone simulation — and input and output data structures tailored to facilitate third party module and interface development. Other planned simulation capabilities include multizone airflow, and electric power and solar thermal and photovoltaic simulation. Beta testing of EnergyPlus began in late 1999 and the first release is scheduled for early 2001."

abstract = "This work presents and illustrates the application of hydroPSO, a novel multi-OS and model-independent R package used for model calibration. hydroPSO allows the modeller to perform a standard modelling work flow including, sensitivity analysis, parameter calibration, and assessment of the calibration results, using a single piece of software. hydroPSO implements several state-of-the-art enhancements and fine-tuning options to the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm to meet specific user needs. hydroPSO easily interfaces the calibration engine to different model codes through simple ASCII files and/or R wrapper functions for exchanging information on the calibration parameters. Then, optimises a user-defined goodness-of-fit measure until a maximum number of iterations or a convergence criterion are met. Finally, advanced plotting functionalities facilitate the interpretation and assessment of the calibration results. The current hydroPSO version allows easy parallelization and works with single-objective functions, with multi-objective functionalities being the subject of ongoing development. We compare hydroPSO against standard algorithms (SCE_UA, DE, DREAM, SPSO-2011, and GML) using a series of benchmark functions. We further illustrate the application of hydroPSO in two real-world case studies: we calibrate, first, a hydrological model for the Ega River Basin (Spain) and, second, a groundwater flow model for the Pampa del Tamarugal Aquifer (Chile). Results from the comparison exercise indicate that hydroPSO is: i) effective and efficient compared to commonly used optimisation algorithms, ii) “scalable”, i.e. maintains a high performance for increased problem dimensionality, and iii) versatile to adapt to different response surfaces of the objective function. Case study results highlight the functionality and ease of use of hydroPSO to handle several issues that are commonly faced by the modelling community such as: working on different operating systems, single or batch model execution, transient- or steady-state modelling conditions, and the use of alternative goodness-of-fit measures to drive parameter optimisation. Although we limit the application of hydroPSO to hydrological models, flexibility of the package suggests it can be implemented in a wider range of models requiring some form of parameter optimisation."

abstract     = {Buildings of the future are expected to not only be energy efficient but also able to offer grid services through implementation of demand-side management strategies by utilizing existing and new technologies that enhance electrical load flexibility. With the high penetration of variable renewables, grid operators have to balance between variable supply with controllable and adaptable demand. This article reviews the current literature on grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) that can provide grid services. In particular, the review identifies categories and examples of measures and technologies that are suitable for GEBs using various criteria. These criteria include demand-side management strategies, potential to provide grid services, technology maturity, as well as ability to model the technologies to perform detailed analyses and assessments in whole-building simulation software.},
