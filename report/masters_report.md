# 1. Introduction

In the United States, the electricity grid continues to experience rapid changes both on the supply and demand sides. On the supply side, its generation fuel mix is shifting away from coal and nuclear sources towards natural gas and renewable energy sources. At the same time, grid operators must balance an increasing supply of non-dispatchable and intermittently available renewable sources such as wind and solar, which are projected to be the fastest growing electricity resource through 2050 (EIA, 2020). On the demand side, an increasing share of demand is now met by distributed energy resources (DER) such as solar photovoltaics (PV), which are also supplying energy to the grid through net metering. These changes are driven mostly by retiring less efficient fossil fuel-based generation sources, low natural gas prices, policies supporting renewable energy, and continued decline in renewable energy costs. At the same time, concerns about climate change have also begun to shift both supply-side and demand-side fuel sources away from fossil fuel-based sources to renewable energy sources. Utilities are committing to 100% renewable energy goals as municipalities adopt electrification policies for buildings in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.

Fundamentally, grid operators must balance electricity supply with demand. In order for the operators to have enough generation capacity in reserve to meet periods of high peak demands, utilities need to build new generation capacity requiring costly and long-term investments. To defer the construction of new generation capacity, utilities often implement programs that reduce, shed, or shift load through demand-side management (DSM), energy efficiency, or demand response (DR) programs. Buildings, which collectively consumed 63% of delivered electricity in the U.S. in 2019 (15% residential, 12% commercial, 35% industrial, EIA 2020), have the potential to offer grid services through implementation of DSM strategies that enhance electrical load flexibility. Grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) that use existing and new technologies to provide demand flexibility have recently emerged as a way to balance the grid's supply and demand and a source of value through avoided electricity system costs (DOE, 2019a).

# 2. Methodology

The analysis used a reference building energy model from the U.S. Department of Energy Commercial Reference Building Models (Deru et. al., 2011) as the starting point for evaluating the technologies, henceforth referred to as the baseline. The reference building models are collectively representative of over 60% of the commercial building stock in the United States and are meant to represent generic existing and new buildings rather than a specific individual building. The Medium Office model was chosen because it is most representative of the commercial building stock in the United States based on area (EIA, 2012). 

## Baseline Model Inputs

The baseline model was created with OpenStudio (NREL, 2011) using the Create Prototype Building measure. Measures are formal computer scripts written in the Ruby programming language that can interact with an OpenStudio model directly, change the EnergyPlus model during runtime, or produce reports after simulation (Roth et. al, 2016). Several changes to the baseline model were required to allow the application of specific technologies, which are described in the Measures secion. In total, the changes decreased the energy use intensity (EUI) by 0.9% and increased the peak electric demand by 10.2% (unadjusted facility) and 4.8% (adjusted utility).

### Thermal Storage (A1)

This EnergyPlus measure changes the selected construction layer to a `MaterialProperty:PhaseChange` object. This object requires the conduction finite difference heat balance algorithm rather than the default conduction transfer function algorithm, which requires constant material properties (e.g. specific heat). The object properties come from the `CondFD1ZonePurchAirAutoSizeWithPCM.idf` EnergyPlus example file as shown below. 

```
MaterialProperty:PhaseChange,
  Typical Insulation R-10.02,             !- Name
  0,                                      !- Temperature Coefficient for Thermal Conductivity {W/m-K2}
  -20,                                    !- Temperature 1 {C}
  0.1,                                    !- Enthalpy 1 {J/kg}
  22,                                     !- Temperature 2 {C}
  18260,                                  !- Enthalpy 2 {J/kg}
  22.1,                                   !- Temperature 3 {C}
  32000,                                  !- Enthalpy 3 {J/kg}
  60,                                     !- Temperature 4 {C}
  71000;                                  !- Enthalpy 4 {J/kg}
```

The `MaterialProperty:PhaseChange` object describes the temperature-enthalpy relationship of the Material object referenced by the Name field. The `Temperature Coefficient for Thermal Conductivity` field describes the material's thermal conductivity change per unit temperature from 20C in W/m-K2. Thermal conductivity is calculated from:

k = {k_o} + {k_1}({T_i} - 20)

where:

k\(_{o}\) is the 20C value of thermal conductivity(normal idf~ input)

k\(_{1}\) is the change in conductivity per degree temperature difference from 20C

For this analysis, the baseline heat balance algorithm was changed to conduction finite difference and the phase change material was added to the interior layer of all exterior walls because the phase change temperature occurs at 22C as shown in figure x.

The annual energy use intensity and energy cost savings for this measure is shown in Figures x. and x. below. This measure was excluded from the optimization because the energy cost savings of 0.1% were small compared to the baseline.

### Dynamic Glazing (A2)
 
This OpenStudio measure adds `ShadingControl` objects to the model by specifying a Construction with shading. The `ShadingControl` objects are translated to EnergyPlus `WindowShadingControl` objects prior to simulation. The Construction must be a detailed fenestration, i.e. be composed of `WindowMaterialGlazing` rather than `WindowMaterialSimpleGlazingSystem`. The object below shows an example.

```

The `WindowShadingControl` object is used to reduce solar radiation into the thermal zone through a window. For this measure, the Shading Type was set to `SwitchableGlazing`, which allows modeling simple two-state electrochromic glazing by referencing a construction for the tinted state in the `Construction with Shading Type` field. The `Shading Control Type` was set to `OnIfHighSolarOnWindow`, which turns the switchable glazing on to its tinted state if the beam plus diffuse solar radiation incident on the window exceeds the setpoint (20 W/m2). 

Modeling electrochromic glazing required the baseline window constructions to be changed from `WindowMaterial:SimpleGlazingSystem`, which models an entire window assembly as a simple monolithic layer, to a more detailed layered construction made up of `WindowMaterial:Glazing` and `WindowMaterial:Gas` objects. The untinted ("bleached") and tinted ("colored") window constructions were taken from the `WindowConstructs.idf` EnergyPlus example file, specifically a double-glazed air-filled electrochromic construction. The objects below show the window constructions before and after the changes to the baseline.

### Automated Attachments (A3)

This measure is the same as A2, but adds shading control for an interior shade that covers the window when incident beam plus diffuse solar radiation exceeds 20 W/m2 as shown below.

In EnergyPlus, shades are modeled as perfect diffusers, i.e. all transmitted and reflected radiation is hemispherically-diffuse. Transmittance and reflectance are independent of the angle of incidence and the reflectance and emissivity properties are the same on both sides. Like A2, this measure required replacing the baseline's window construction with a detailed layered construction. Additionally, a construction with the shade was added to the model so that it was available to the measure (but unused in the baseline, see below). The `WindowMaterial:Shade` object was taken from the `WindowShadeMaterials.idf` EnergyPlus data set and represents a shade with medium reflectance and medium transmittance as shown below.

### Continuous-Operation Electronics (E1)

This EnergyPlus measure adds a `DemandManager:ElectricEquipment` object to the model. The measure will also add a `DemandManagerAssignmentList` object if one is not present in the model. If one is, it will add the `DemandManager:ElectricEquipment` to the existing `DemandManagerAssignmentList`. The object properties come from the `5ZoneAirCooledDemandLimiting.idf` EnergyPlus example file as shown below.

The `DemandManager:ElectricEquipment` object in EnergyPlus allows modeling common demand side management strategies to reduce power to electric equipment. The `Limit Control` field specifies whether demand limiting is on (Fixed) or off. The DemandManager module in EnergyPlus determines whether demand limiting is required during a simulation timestep and if so, the power to the referenced electric equipment is reduced up to the `Maximum Limit Fraction` field, which was 50% in this case. The `Minimum Limit Duration` specifies the minimum amount of time that demand is reduced, which was 60 minutes for this analysis. The `DemandManager:AssignmentList` object controls one or more demand managers by specifying the `Demand Window Length` (in minumtes) and coordinating the `Demand Manager Priority` with other demand managers, e.g. lights or thermostats (measures C1 and C2 respectively). Priority can be set to sequentially rotate through demand managers or simultaneously limit demand to all objects.

The annual energy use intensity and energy cost savings for this measure is shown in Figures x. and x. below.

### Separate Sensible and Latent Space Conditioning (M1)

This EnergyPlus measure adds a `Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System` on the selected air stream (outdoor air or supply air) of one or all air loops in the model. The measure works by replacing a surrogate object in the desired location in the air stream with the desiccant dehumidifier system. A setpoint manager must be present on the outlet node of the surrogate object to control humidity. If the system will be added to the supply air stream, the surrogate object must be directly downstream of a cooling coil, which will be the companion cooling coil to the desiccant system. The measure uses objects from the `DesiccantDehumidifierWithCompanionCoil.idf` EnergyPlus example file shown below.

This object is a parent object that references several child components, which include an air-to-air heat exchanger, an exhaust fan (optional), and a regeneration fan and heating coil (optional) to regenerate the desiccant. The operation of the desiccant system can be coordinated with a companion cooling coil by specifying its type and name in the appropriate fields. This measure required adding humidity controls to all zones served by the air loops and replacing the `Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed` objects with `Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed` objects in the baseline model. Humidity controls were set to 45% relative humidity. The desiccant dehumidifier system was placed downstream of the cooling coil on the supply air stream of all three air loops in the model.

This object is a black box model composed of a condenser, evaporator, compressor, and thermal energy storage (TES) tank that ineracts with its surroundings through condenser inlet and outlet, evaporator inlet and outlet, heat transfer between the TES tank and environment, and optional TES tank plant loop connection. The coil object has six built-in operating modes summarized in the table below that are used if the `Operating Mode Control Method` field is set to `ScheduledModes`. 

Operating Mode | Description
:- | :-
Off Mode | Object is not cooling with either the coil or TES tank, but the tank continues to be modeled as it exchanges heat with the environment.
Cooling Only Mode | Object is cooling with the coil the same as a normal single speed DX coil, but is not charging or discharging the TES tank which continues to be modeled as it exchanges heat with the environment.
Cool and Charge Mode | Object is cooling with the coil and is charging the TES tank (all components are active). Electric power to the compressor is split to model equipment with dual compressors with separate performance characteristics for evaporator cooling and one for charging the TES tank.
Cool and Discharge Mode | Object is cooling with the coil and discharging from the TES tank (all components are active). Electric power to the compressor is split to model equipment with dual compressors with separate performance characteristics for evaporator cooling and one for cooling from the TES tank.
Charge Only Mode | Object is charging the TES tank only and the evaporator is off. 
Discharge Only Mode | Object is cooling by discharging the TES tank and the condenser is off. 

The `EMSControlled` mode allows for custom user-specified control using the EnergyPlus EnergyManagementSystem (EMS) objects, which was used in this analysis. The following shows the EMS objects used to control the TES coils.

### Building-Scale CHP (P1)

This OpenStudio measure adds a `GeneratorMicroTurbineHeatRecovery` object to the supply side of plant loop with a water heater. The micro turbine provides electricity generation and service water heating through exhaust air heat recovery. This object is translated to the EnergyPlus object `Generator:MicroTurbine` for simulation, which is a Capstone C65 from the EnergyPlus `HeatRecoveryPlantLoopAuto.idf` example file (and others) as shown below.

The measure code and topology are based on https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-resources/blob/develop/model/simulationtests/generator_microturbine.rb. The topology differs from the EnergyPlus example file because OpenStudio does not currently allow a water heater object on the same side of two different plant loops. The `Generator:MicroTurbine` object generates electric energy for the building and can optionally recover waste heat from the exhaust air stream to heat water for space or service water heating as was the case for this analysis. The `ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution` object defines the operatation scheme of one or more generators, with the following options summarized below. 

Operation Scheme Type | Description
:- | :-
Baseload | Operates the generator at its rated electric power output even if it exceeds the total facility electric demand, subject to its availability schedule in the `ElectricLoadCenter:Generators` object.
DemandLimit | Limits the electric demand from the grid by trying to meet the demand above the limit set in the `Generator Demand Limit Scheme Purchased Electric Demand Limit` field.
TrackElectrical | Attempts to meet all of the electrical demand for the facility. 
TrackSchedule | Attempts to meet all of the electrical demand determined by a user-defined schedule. 
TrackMeter | Attempts to meet all the electrical demand from an EnergyPlus Meter.
FollowThermal | Attempts to meet the thermal demand. Excess electrical generation is exported to the grid.
FollowThermalLimitElectrical | Attempts to meet the thermal demand, but limits electrical output to the current electrical demand so that no electricity is exported to the grid.

For this analysis, the `Generator Operation Scheme Type` was set to limit demand (DemandLimit) to the annual low of 290 kW, which occurs in July. This option produced the lowest energy cost and use compared to other options as shown below.

### Advanced Sensors and Controls (lighting) (C1)

This EnergyPlus measure adds a `DemandManager:Lights` object to the model. The measure will also add a `DemandManagerAssignmentList` object if one is not present in the model. If one is, it will add the `DemandManager:Lights` to the existing `DemandManagerAssignmentList`. The object properties come from the `5ZoneAirCooledDemandLimiting.idf` EnergyPlus example file as shown below.

```

```

Similar to E1, this measure reduces power to a specific energy end use category up to a fractional limit for the specified duration, which for this analysis was 50% and 60 minutes respectively.

### Smart Thermostats (C2)

This EnergyPlus measure adds a `DemandManager:Thermostats` object to the model. The measure will also add a `DemandManagerAssignmentList` object if one is not present in the model. If one is, it will add the `DemandManager:Thermostats` to the existing `DemandManagerAssignmentList`. The object properties come from the `5ZoneAirCooledDemandLimiting.idf` EnergyPlus example file as shown below.

```

```

Instead of a fractional reduction in load, like E1 and C1, this object specifies maximum setpoint resets for heating and cooling, which for this analysis were set to 19C and 26C respectively. 

The annual energy use intensity and energy cost savings for this measure is shown in Figures x. and x. below.
