# 1. Introduction

In the United States, the electricity grid continues to experience rapid changes both on the supply and demand sides. On the supply side, its generation fuel mix is shifting away from coal and nuclear sources towards natural gas and renewable energy sources. At the same time, grid operators must balance an increasing supply of non-dispatchable and intermittently available renewable sources such as wind and solar, which are projected to be the fastest growing electricity resource through 2050 (EIA, 2020). On the demand side, an increasing share of demand is now met by distributed energy resources (DER) such as solar photovoltaics (PV), which are also supplying energy to the grid through net metering. These changes are driven mostly by retiring less efficient fossil fuel-based generation sources, low natural gas prices, policies supporting renewable energy, and continued decline in renewable energy costs. At the same time, concerns about climate change have also begun to shift both supply-side and demand-side fuel sources away from fossil fuel-based sources to renewable energy sources. Utilities are committing to 100% renewable energy goals as municipalities adopt electrification policies for buildings in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.

Fundamentally, grid operators must balance electricity supply with demand. In order for the operators to have enough generation capacity in reserve to meet periods of high peak demands, utilities need to build new generation capacity requiring costly and long-term investments. To defer the construction of new generation capacity, utilities often implement programs that reduce, shed, or shift load through demand-side management (DSM), energy efficiency, or demand response (DR) programs. Buildings, which collectively consumed 63% of delivered electricity in the U.S. in 2019 (15% residential, 12% commercial, 35% industrial, EIA 2020), have the potential to offer grid services through implementation of DSM strategies that enhance electrical load flexibility. Grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) that use existing and new technologies to provide demand flexibility have recently emerged as a way to balance the grid's supply and demand and a source of value through avoided electricity system costs (DOE, 2019a).

# 2. Methodology

The analysis used a reference building energy model from the U.S. Department of Energy Commercial Reference Building Models (Deru et. al., 2011) as the starting point for evaluating the technologies, henceforth referred to as the baseline. The reference building models are collectively representative of over 60% of the commercial building stock in the United States and are meant to represent generic existing and new buildings rather than a specific individual building. The Medium Office model was chosen because it is most representative of the commercial building stock in the United States based on area (EIA, 2012). 

## Baseline Model Inputs

The baseline model was created with OpenStudio (NREL, 2011) using the Create Prototype Building measure. Measures are formal computer scripts written in the Ruby programming language that can interact with an OpenStudio model directly, change the EnergyPlus model during runtime, or produce reports after simulation (Roth et. al, 2016). Several changes to the baseline model were required to allow the application of specific technologies, which are described in the Measures secion. In total, the changes decreased the energy use intensity (EUI) by 0.9% and increased the peak electric demand by 10.2% (unadjusted facility) and 4.8% (adjusted utility).

### Thermal Storage (A1)

This measure adds the EnergyPlus object `MaterialProperty:PhaseChange` (DOE, 2020) to all interior surfaces in the model. The object's properties were taken from the EnergyPlus example file `MaterialPropertyPhaseChange.idf` (DOE, 2020) shown below.

```
	MaterialProperty:PhaseChange,
		#{construction_interior_layer_name},  !- Name
		0,                       !- Temperature Coefficient for Thermal Conductivity {W/m-K2}
		-20,                     !- Temperature 1 {C}
		0.1,                     !- Enthalpy 1 {J/kg}
		22,                      !- Temperature 2 {C}
		18260,                   !- Enthalpy 2 {J/kg}
		22.1,                    !- Temperature 3 {C}
		32000,                   !- Enthalpy 3 {J/kg}
		60,                      !- Temperature 4 {C}
		71000;                   !- Enthalpy 4 {J/kg}
```

The `MaterialProperty:PhaseChange` object describes the temperature-enthalpy relationship of the Material object referenced by the Name field. This object requires the use of EnergyPlus' conduction finite difference heat balance algorithm, rather than its default conduction transfer function (CTF) method, because the CTF requires constant material properties (e.g. specific heat), which was one of the required changes to the baseline model for this analysis. Additionally, the timestep was changed from six per hour to 12 per hour to accomodate the phase change material. The `Temperature Coefficient for Thermal Conductivity` field describes the material's thermal conductivity change per unit temperature from 20C in W/m-K2. Thermal conductivity is calculated from:

k = {k_o} + {k_1}({T_i} - 20)

where:

k\(_{o}\) is the 20C value of thermal conductivity(normal idf~ input)

k\(_{1}\) is the change in conductivity per degree temperature difference from 20C

The annual energy use intensity and energy cost savings for this measure is shown in Figures x. and x. below.

```

The `WindowShadingControl` object is used to reduce solar radiation into the thermal zone through a window. For this measure, the Shading Type was set to `SwitchableGlazing`, which allows modeling simple two-state electrochromic glazing by referencing a construction for the tinted state in the `Construction with Shading Type` field. Modeling electrochromic glazing required the baseline window constructions to be changed from `WindowMaterial:SimpleGlazingSystem`, which models an entire window assembly as a simple monolithic layer, to a more detailed layered construction made up of `WindowMaterial:Glazing` and `WindowMaterial:Gas` objects. In this case, both the untinted and the tinted window constructions were taken from the `WindowConstructs.idf` EnergyPlus example file, specifically the . The objects below show the window constructions before and after the changes to the baseline.

For this measure, the Shading Type was set to `InteriorShade`, which allows modeling a diffusing shade located on the inside of the window by referencing a construction with a `WindowMaterial:Shade` objecct in the `Construction with Shading Type` field. Like the A2, this measure required replacing the baseline's window construction with a detailed layered construction. Additionally, a construction with the shade was added to the model so that it was available to the measure (but unused in the baseline) as shown in the objects below. The `WindowMaterial:Shade` object was taken from the `WindowShadeMaterials.idf` EnergyPlus data set.

  DemandManager:ElectricEquipment,        !- DemandManager Object Type 1
  Demand Manager Electric Equipment;      !- DemandManager Name 1
```

The `DemandManager:ElectricEquipment` object in EnergyPlus allows modeling common demand side management strategies to reduce power to electric equipment. The `Limit Control` field specifies whether demand limiting is on (Fixed) or off. The `DemandManager module in EnergyPlus determines whether demand limiting is required during a timestep and if so, the power to the referenced Electric Equipment is reduced by the `Maximum Limit Fraction` field. The `DemandManager:AssignmentList` object controls one or more DemandManager objects by allowing the Demand Window Length (in minumtes) and Demand Manager Priority (either Sequential or All) to be specified.

The annual energy use intensity and energy cost savings for this measure is shown in Figures x. and x. below.

### Thermal Energy Storage (M2)

This [measure](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-load-flexibility-measures-gem/releases/tag/v0.1.3) replaces CoilSystem:Cooling:DX objects in the model with the EnergyPlus object [Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage](https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/9-4/input-output-reference/group-heating-and-cooling-coils.html#coilcoolingdxsinglespeedthermalstorage). 

The annual energy use intensity and energy cost savings for this measure is shown in Figures x. and x. below.

### Building-Scale CHP (P1)

This measure adds the OpenStudio object [GeneratorMicroTurbineHeatRecovery](https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/9-4/input-output-reference/group-electric-load-center-generator.html#generatormicroturbine) to the model. The object's properties come from the EnergyPlus example file `HeatRecoveryPlantLoopAuto.idf`, which is based on the Capstone C65, and is located on the supply side of a plant loop with a water heater object. The object generates electric energy for the building and waste thermal energy is used for service hot water. The measure's code and topology is based on https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-resources/blob/develop/model/simulationtests/generator_microturbine.rb. The topology differs from the example file because OpenStudio does not allow WaterHeater objects on the same side of two different plant loops.

The annual energy use intensity and energy cost savings for this measure is shown in Figures x. and x. below.
