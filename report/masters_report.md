# 1. Introduction

In the United States, the electricity grid continues to experience rapid changes both on the supply and demand sides. On the supply side, its generation fuel mix is shifting away from coal and nuclear sources towards natural gas and renewable energy sources. At the same time, grid operators must balance an increasing supply of non-dispatchable and intermittently available renewable sources such as wind and solar, which are projected to be the fastest growing electricity resource through 2050 (EIA, 2020). On the demand side, an increasing share of demand is now met by distributed energy resources (DER) such as solar photovoltaics (PV), which are also supplying energy to the grid through net metering. These changes are driven mostly by retiring less efficient fossil fuel-based generation sources, low natural gas prices, policies supporting renewable energy, and continued decline in renewable energy costs. At the same time, concerns about climate change have also begun to shift both supply-side and demand-side fuel sources away from fossil fuel-based sources to renewable energy sources. Utilities are committing to 100% renewable energy goals as municipalities adopt electrification policies for buildings in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.

Fundamentally, grid operators must balance electricity supply with demand. In order for the operators to have enough generation capacity in reserve to meet periods of high peak demands, utilities need to build new generation capacity requiring costly and long-term investments. To defer the construction of new generation capacity, utilities often implement programs that reduce, shed, or shift load through demand-side management (DSM), energy efficiency, or demand response (DR) programs. Buildings, which collectively consumed 63% of delivered electricity in the U.S. in 2019 (15% residential, 12% commercial, 35% industrial, EIA 2020), have the potential to offer grid services through implementation of DSM strategies that enhance electrical load flexibility. Grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) that use existing and new technologies to provide demand flexibility have recently emerged as a way to balance the grid's supply and demand and a source of value through avoided electricity system costs (DOE, 2019a).

# 2. Methodology

The analysis used a reference building energy model from the U.S. Department of Energy Commercial Reference Building Models (Deru et. al., 2011) as the starting point for evaluating the technologies, henceforth referred to as the baseline. The reference building models are collectively representative of over 60% of the commercial building stock in the United States and are meant to represent generic existing and new buildings rather than a specific individual building. The Medium Office model was chosen because it is most representative of the commercial building stock in the United States based on area (EIA, 2012). 

## Baseline Model Inputs

The baseline model was created with OpenStudio (NREL, 2011) using the Create Prototype Building measure. Measures are formal computer scripts written in the Ruby programming language that can interact with an OpenStudio model directly, change the EnergyPlus model during runtime, or produce reports after simulation (Roth et. al, 2016). Several changes to the baseline model were required to allow the application of specific technologies, which are described in the Measures secion. In total, the changes decreased the energy use intensity (EUI) by 0.9% and increased the peak electric demand by 10.2% (unadjusted facility) and 4.8% (adjusted utility).
