# 1. Introduction

In the United States, the electricity grid continues to experience rapid changes both on the supply and demand sides. On the supply side, its generation fuel mix is shifting away from coal and nuclear sources towards natural gas and renewable energy sources. At the same time, grid operators must balance an increasing supply of non-dispatchable and intermittently available renewable sources such as wind and solar, which are projected to be the fastest growing electricity resource through 2050 (EIA, 2020). On the demand side, an increasing share of demand is now met by distributed energy resources (DER) such as solar photovoltaics (PV), which are also supplying energy to the grid through net metering. These changes are driven mostly by retiring less efficient fossil fuel-based generation sources, low natural gas prices, policies supporting renewable energy, and continued decline in renewable energy costs. At the same time, concerns about climate change have also begun to shift both supply-side and demand-side fuel sources away from fossil fuel-based sources to renewable energy sources. Utilities are committing to 100% renewable energy goals as municipalities adopt electrification policies for buildings in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.

Fundamentally, grid operators must balance electricity supply with demand. In order for the operators to have enough generation capacity in reserve to meet periods of high peak demands, utilities need to build new generation capacity requiring costly and long-term investments. To defer the construction of new generation capacity, utilities often implement programs that reduce, shed, or shift load through demand-side management (DSM), energy efficiency, or demand response (DR) programs. Buildings, which collectively consumed 63% of delivered electricity in the U.S. in 2019 (15% residential, 12% commercial, 35% industrial, EIA 2020), have the potential to offer grid services through implementation of DSM strategies that enhance electrical load flexibility. Grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) that use existing and new technologies to provide demand flexibility have recently emerged as a way to balance the grid's supply and demand and a source of value through avoided electricity system costs (DOE, 2019a).

This report builds upon previous work that reviewed and categorized GEB technologies (Steen et. al., 2020) by quantitatively evaluating these technologies using building performance simulation. The following sections describe the methodology, results, and conclusions of the analysis. 

# 2. Methodology

The analysis used a reference building energy model from the U.S. Department of Energy Commercial Reference Building Models (Deru et. al., 2011) as the starting point for evaluating the technologies, henceforth referred to as the baseline. The reference building models are EnergyPlus models (Crawley et. al., 2001) that are collectively representative of over 60% of the commercial building stock in the United States and are meant to represent generic existing and new buildings rather than a specific individual building. The Medium Office model was chosen because it is most representative of the commercial building stock in the United States based on area (EIA, 2012). 

## 2.1 Baseline Model Inputs

The baseline model was created with OpenStudio (Guglielmetti et. al., 2011) using the Create Prototype Building measure. Measures are formal computer scripts written in the Ruby programming language that can interact with an OpenStudio model directly (an OpenStudio Measure), change the EnergyPlus model prior to simulation (an EnergyPlus Measure), or produce reports after simulation with Reporting Measures (Roth et. al, 2016). Several changes to the baseline model were required to allow the application of specific technologies, which are described in the Measures section. In total, the changes decreased the energy use intensity (EUI) by 0.9% and increased the peak electric demand by 10.2% (unadjusted facility) and 4.8% (adjusted utility).

### 2.3.1 Thermal Storage (A1)

This EnergyPlus measure adds phase change properties to the selected material by adding a `MaterialProperty:PhaseChange` object. This object requires the conduction finite difference heat balance algorithm rather than the default conduction transfer function algorithm, which requires constant material properties (e.g. specific heat). The object properties come from the `CondFD1ZonePurchAirAutoSizeWithPCM.idf` EnergyPlus example file as shown below. 

```
MaterialProperty:PhaseChange,
  5/8 in. Gypsum Board,                   !- Name
  0,                                      !- Temperature Coefficient for Thermal Conductivity {W/m-K2}
  -20,                                    !- Temperature 1 {C}
  0.1,                                    !- Enthalpy 1 {J/kg}
  22,                                     !- Temperature 2 {C}
  18260,                                  !- Enthalpy 2 {J/kg}
  22.1,                                   !- Temperature 3 {C}
  32000,                                  !- Enthalpy 3 {J/kg}
  60,                                     !- Temperature 4 {C}
  71000;                                  !- Enthalpy 4 {J/kg}
```

The `MaterialProperty:PhaseChange` object describes the temperature-enthalpy relationship of the Material object referenced by the Name field. The `Temperature Coefficient for Thermal Conductivity` field describes the material's thermal conductivity change per unit temperature from 20C in W/m-K2. Thermal conductivity is calculated from:

k = {k_o} + {k_1}({T_i} - 20)

where:

k\(_{o}\) is the 20C value of thermal conductivity(normal idf~ input)

k\(_{1}\) is the change in conductivity per degree temperature difference from 20C

For this analysis, the baseline heat balance algorithm was changed to conduction finite difference and the phase change material was added to the interior layer of all walls, i.e. the layer exposed to the thermal zone, because the phase change temperature occurs at 22C as shown in figure x.

### 2.3.2 Dynamic Glazing (A2)
 
This OpenStudio measure adds `ShadingControl` objects to the model by specifying a Construction with shading. The `ShadingControl` objects are translated to EnergyPlus `WindowShadingControl` objects prior to simulation. The Construction must be a detailed fenestration, i.e. be composed of `WindowMaterialGlazing` rather than `WindowMaterialSimpleGlazingSystem`. The object below shows an example.

```

The `WindowShadingControl` object is used to reduce solar radiation through a window into the referenced thermal zone. For this measure, the Shading Type was set to `SwitchableGlazing`, which allows modeling simple two-state electrochromic glazing by referencing a construction for the tinted state in the `Construction with Shading Type` field. 

Modeling electrochromic glazing required the baseline window constructions to be changed from `WindowMaterial:SimpleGlazingSystem`, which models an entire window assembly as a simple monolithic layer, to a more detailed layered construction made up of `WindowMaterial:Glazing` and `WindowMaterial:Gas` objects. The untinted ("bleached") and tinted ("colored") window constructions were taken from the `WindowConstructs.idf` EnergyPlus data set file, specifically a double-glazed air-filled electrochromic construction. The objects below show the window constructions before and after the changes to the baseline.

### 2.3.3 Automated Attachments (A3)

This measure is the same as A2, but adds shading control for an interior shade that covers the window according to the control type as shown in the example object below.

In EnergyPlus, shades are modeled as perfect diffusers, i.e. all transmitted and reflected radiation is hemispherically-diffuse. Transmittance and reflectance are independent of the angle of incidence and the reflectance and emissivity properties are the same on both sides. Like A2, this measure required replacing the baseline's window construction with a detailed layered construction. Additionally, a construction with the shade was added to the model so that it was available to the measure (but unused in the baseline, see below). The `WindowMaterial:Shade` object was taken from the `WindowShadeMaterials.idf` EnergyPlus data set and represents a shade with medium reflectance and medium transmittance as shown below.

### 2.3.4 Continuous-Operation Electronics (E1)

This EnergyPlus measure adds a `DemandManager:ElectricEquipment` object to the model. The measure will also add a `DemandManagerAssignmentList` object if one is not present in the model. If one is, it will add the `DemandManager:ElectricEquipment` to the existing `DemandManagerAssignmentList`. The following objects are examples from the `5ZoneAirCooledDemandLimiting.idf` EnergyPlus example file.

The `DemandManager:ElectricEquipment` object in EnergyPlus allows modeling common demand side management strategies to reduce power to electric equipment. The `Limit Control` field specifies whether demand limiting is on (Fixed) or off. The DemandManager module in EnergyPlus determines whether demand limiting is required during a simulation timestep and if so, the power to the referenced electric equipment is reduced up to the `Maximum Limit Fraction` field. The `Minimum Limit Duration` specifies the minimum amount of time that demand is reduced. The `DemandManager:AssignmentList` object controls one or more demand managers by specifying the `Demand Window Length` (in minutes) and coordinating the `Demand Manager Priority` with other demand managers, e.g. lights or thermostats (measures C1 and C2 respectively). Priority can be set to sequentially rotate through demand managers or simultaneously limit demand to all objects.

### 2.3.5 Separate Sensible and Latent Space Conditioning (M1)

This EnergyPlus measure adds a `Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System` on the selected air stream (outdoor air or supply air) of one or all air loops in the model. The measure works by replacing a surrogate object in the desired location in the air stream with the desiccant dehumidifier system. A setpoint manager must be present on the outlet node of the surrogate object to control humidity. If the system will be added to the supply air stream, the surrogate object must be directly downstream of a cooling coil, which will be the companion cooling coil to the desiccant system. The measure uses objects from the `DesiccantDehumidifierWithCompanionCoil.idf` EnergyPlus example file shown below.

This object is a parent object that references several child components, which include an air-to-air heat exchanger (HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow), an exhaust fan (optional), and a regeneration fan and heating coil (optional) to regenerate the desiccant. The operation of the desiccant system can be coordinated with a companion cooling coil by specifying its type and name in the appropriate fields. This measure required adding humidity controls to all zones served by the air loops and replacing the `Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed` objects with `Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed` objects in the baseline model. Humidity controls were set to 45% relative humidity. 

### 2.3.6 Thermal Energy Storage (M2)

This measure replaces the `Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed` objects on the supply air stream of one or more air loops in the model with `Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage` objects (TODO, https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-load-flexibility-measures-gem/tree/master/lib/measures/add_packaged_ice_storage) as shown in the example object below.

This object is a black box model composed of a condenser, evaporator, compressor, and thermal energy storage (TES) tank that interacts with its surroundings through condenser inlet and outlet, evaporator inlet and outlet, heat transfer between the TES tank and environment, and optional TES tank plant loop connection. The `Operating Mode Control Method` field determines which mode the coil is in during a given time period and has two choices; `EMSControlled` and `ScheduledModes`. With the `EMSControlled` option, the operating mode is determined by EnergyPlus EnergyManagementSystem (EMS) objects that allow custom routines for dynamic supervisory control as shown in the example objects below.

### 2.3.7 Building-Scale CHP (P1)

This OpenStudio measure adds a `GeneratorMicroTurbineHeatRecovery` object to the supply side of plant loop with a water heater. The micro turbine provides electricity generation and service water heating through exhaust air heat recovery. This object is translated to the EnergyPlus object `Generator:MicroTurbine` for simulation, which for this measure is a Capstone C65 from the EnergyPlus `HeatRecoveryPlantLoopAuto.idf` example file (and others) as shown below.

The measure code and topology are based on https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-resources/blob/develop/model/simulationtests/generator_microturbine.rb. The topology differs from the EnergyPlus example file because OpenStudio does not currently allow a water heater object on the same side of two different plant loops. The `Generator:MicroTurbine` object generates electric energy for the building and can optionally recover waste heat from the exhaust air stream to heat water for space or service water heating as was the case for this analysis. The `ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution` object defines the operation scheme of one or more generators, with the following options summarized below. 

Operation Scheme Type | Description
:- | :-
Baseload | Operates the generator at its rated electric power output even if it exceeds the total facility electric demand, subject to its availability schedule in the `ElectricLoadCenter:Generators` object.
DemandLimit | Limits the electric demand from the grid by trying to meet the demand above the limit set in the `Generator Demand Limit Scheme Purchased Electric Demand Limit` field.
TrackElectrical | Attempts to meet all of the electrical demand for the facility. 
TrackSchedule | Attempts to meet all of the electrical demand determined by a user-defined schedule. 
TrackMeter | Attempts to meet all the electrical demand from an EnergyPlus Meter.
FollowThermal | Attempts to meet the thermal demand. Excess electrical generation is exported to the grid.
FollowThermalLimitElectrical | Attempts to meet the thermal demand, but limits electrical output to the current electrical demand so that no electricity is exported to the grid.

### 2.3.8 Advanced Sensors and Controls (lighting) (C1)

This EnergyPlus measure adds a `DemandManager:Lights` object to the model. The measure will also add a `DemandManagerAssignmentList` object if one is not present in the model. If one is, it will add the `DemandManager:Lights` to the existing `DemandManagerAssignmentList`. An example object from the `5ZoneAirCooledDemandLimiting.idf` EnergyPlus example is shown below.

```

	Lights Manager,          !- Name

```

Similar to E1, this measure reduces power to a specific energy end use category up to a fractional limit for the specified duration.

### 2.3.9 Smart Thermostats (C2)

This EnergyPlus measure adds a `DemandManager:Thermostats` object to the model. The measure will also add a `DemandManagerAssignmentList` object if one is not present in the model. If one is, it will add the `DemandManager:Thermostats` to the existing `DemandManagerAssignmentList`. The object below shows an example from the `5ZoneAirCooledDemandLimiting.idf` EnergyPlus example file. Instead of a fractional reduction in load, like E1 and C1, this object specifies maximum setpoint resets for heating and cooling.

## 2.4 Optimization Process

The optimization process focused on each technology individually rather than attempt a large scale inter-optimization across all technologies each with a separate intra-optimization problem of measure-specific variables. Each technology was optimized separately by changing one or more of the measure's inputs to minimize the model's annual energy cost. Energy cost was chosen as a reasonable metric for determining the grid-interactive benefits of a technology because it can include the effects of both energy efficiency and demand without the need for time consuming processing of hourly or sub-hourly model outputs, e.g. to determine peak demand reduction. This approach assumes that the utility company structures its tariffs to minimize the burden on its resources. For this analysis, the local electricity and natural gas tariffs from Xcel Energy in Denver, Colorado were used. The electricity tariff includes seasonal consumption charges for summer and winter with time-of-use demand charges that are the same throughout the year. The natural gas tariff includes annual charges for consumption and demand. OpenStudio's Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT) was used to optimize each technology, which allows users to perform sensitivity analyses, uncertainty quantification, design optimization, and model calibration on a large scale through the use of cloud computing (Ball et. al., 2020). 

# 3. Results

This section presents the optimization of each technology by discussing the process of determining the independent variables to minimize the annual energy cost. For each measure, pre-optimizations were completed in an attempt to reduce the complexity of the problem by identifying a single independent variable to optimize. The annual energy cost and use results for the individual measures are summarized in Figures x. and x. and Table x. below. Additionally, Table x. shows the time the cooling and heating setpoints are not met to verify that any savings were not the result of the mechanical system not meeting loads. Measures A1, M1, and M2 did not include full optimization, which are discussed in the corresponding section.

## 3.1 Thermal Storage (A1)

Initial testing of this measure showed small savings compared to the baseline model when the PCM was added to the inside of all walls. Adding additional PCM to other layers, e.g. ceilings and floors, increased the savings slightly. This technology was excluded from the optimization because this measure showed savings that were small relative to the baseline when using default PCM properties from the EnergyPlus example file. The annual energy use and energy cost savings for this measure are shown in Figures x. and x. below, which showed energy cost and use savings of 0.2% and 0.5% respectively.

## 3.2 Dynamic Glazing (A2)

The optimization of this measure focused on two variables for the EnergyPlus 'WindowShadingControl` object. The `Shading Control Type` field, a discrete variable which currently has 21 options for high level control that generally reduce thermal loads, improve visual comfort, or improve daylight; and the `Setpoint` field, a continuous variable that allows additional control based on solar radiation (W/m2), temperature (C), or cooling or heating (W). The shading control options are summarized in Table x below.

The pre-optimization process focused on shading control types to reduce heating loads since the model's peak electric demand occurs in the winter months due to air terminals with electric reheat. Furthermore, the selected shading control types were limited to ones that use indoor or outdoor air temperature for setpoint control. Table x. summarizes the pre-optimization variables for this measure.

__Table x. Measure A2 Optimization Variables__

Shading Control Type (discrete) | Setpoints (continuous)
:- | :-
OnNightIfLowInsideTempAndOffDay | 15-21C in 1C increments
OnNightIfLowOutdoorTempAndOffDay | 0-20C in 5C increments
OnNightIfLowOutdoorTempAndOnDayIfCooling | 0-20C in 5C increments

The pre-optimization was comprised of two separate runs using the Baseline Perturbation analysis option in PAT to determine the magnitude and direction of utility cost savings; one for `OnNightIfLowOutdoorTempAndOffDay` and `OnNightIfLowOutdoorTempAndOnDayIfCooling` shading controls, which use an outdoor air temperature setpoint; and one for `OnNightIfLowInsideTempAndOffDay`, which uses an indoor air temperature setpoint. Of these 17 simulations, the `OnNightIfLowOutdoorTempAndOnDayIfCooling` shading control was the only one that showed significant energy cost savings compared to the baseline with the other two shading control types showing very small energy cost increases.

The optimization of this measure used the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) analysis option in PAT, which is based on hydroPSO (Zambrano-Bigiarini et. al., 2013) with a single independent variable, the outdoor air temperature setpoint, to minimize the annual energy cost. The as shown in Figure x. 

![image](images/measure_a2_optimization_results.png)

__Figure x. Measure A2 Optimization Results__

The annual energy cost and use savings for the optimized setpoint of 20.64C is shown in Figures x. and x. below, which showed a savings of 10.3% and 6.1% respectively.

## 3.3 Automated Attachments (A3)

The optimization of this technology used the same methodology as measure A2. The pre-optimization showed similar results as A2, with the `OnNightIfLowOutdoorTempAndOnDayIfCooling` shading control showing the greatest annual energy cost savings compared to the baseline. This control option was chosen for optimization using the PSO analysis option in PAT with the setpoint as the continuous variable to optimize for the lowest annual energy cost. Figures x, x, and x compare the pre-optimization results showing that the `OnNightIfLowOutdoorTempAndOnDayIfCooling` control option produced the greatest savings.

## 3.4 Continuous-Operation Electronics (E1)

The optimization process for this technology focused on two continuous variables; the `Minimum Limit Duration`, which is the minimum amount of time in minutes that the equipment power is reduced during demand limiting, and the `Maximum Limit Fraction`, which is the fractional limit of full load lighting power reduction where 1.0 indicates no reduction. The optimization first evaluated the effect of the demand limit fraction on the annual energy cost by simulating ten fractions of 0.1 to 1.0 in 0.1 increments. As expected, this variable showed a strong linear relationship with annual energy cost as shown in Figure x below.

![image](images/measure_e1_optimization_results_fraction.png)

__Figure x. Measure E1 Optimization Results for Fraction__

Next, the optimization evaluated the effect of the demand limit duration on the energy cost by simulating durations between 10 minutes and 320 minutes. This variable had a very small effect on the annual energy cost as shown in Figure x. below.

![image](images/measure_e1_optimization_results_duration.png)

__Figure x. Measure E1 Optimization Results for Duration__

The optimization kept the `Maximum Limit Fraction` fixed at 50% and focused on optimizing the `Minimum Limit Duration`. Because the annual energy cost only varied by about 2.00 USD between the discrete variables in the pre-optimization, this analysis forewent a formal optimization and chose a duration of 40 minutes as the value that minimized the annual energy cost. The energy cost and use savings for a 40 minute demand limit duration was % and % as shown in Figure x. and x. below.

## 3.5 Separate Sensible and Latent Space Conditioning (M1)

Initial testing of this measure showed small savings compared to the baseline model using default values from the EnergyPlus example file when the  desiccant dehumidifier system was placed downstream of the cooling coil on the supply air stream of all three air loops in the model. This measure was excluded from the optimization because this technology showed savings that were small relative to the baseline. The annual energy cost and use  savings were % and % respectively as shown in Figures x. and x. below.

## 3.6 Thermal Energy Storage (M2)

The pre-optimization for this measure focused on two discrete variables for the `Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage` object; the `Operating Mode Control Method` and the `Operation Mode Control Schedule Name` fields. The pre-optimization simulated each of the two control methods, EMSControlled and ScheduledModes, with each of the five control schedules to determine the option that minimized the annual energy cost savings compared to the baseline as shown in Figures x. and x. below. For the `Simple User Sched` schedule option, the inputs were kept at default values. Of these eight combinations, the `Simple User Sched` produced the greatest savings with both control methods with the `EMSControlled` method showing greater savings compared to the `Scheduled Modes` option as shown in Figure x. and x. below.

__Figure x. Measure M2 Pre-optimization Results for EMSControlled Control Method__

![image](images/measure_m2_preoptimization_scheduledmodes.png)

__Figure x. Measure M2 Pre-optimization Results for ScheduledModes Control Method__

Based on the pre-optimization results, the `EMSControlled` control method was chosen with the `Simple User Sched` schedule option to optimize the annual energy cost. Four of the five continuous variables for the simple user schedule were chosen to optimize with the season fixed at the default value of 01/01-12/31. The four continuous variables of charge start and end time, and discharge start and end time were optimized with discrete hourly values from 0000 to 2400.

The annual energy use intensity and energy cost savings for this measure is shown in Figures x. and x. below.

The pre-optimization of this measure focused on the `Generator Operation Scheme Type` discrete variable. The `DemandLimit` option produced the lowest energy cost compared to the other operation schemes as shown in Figure x.

The demand limit operation scheme turns on the generator when total demand is above the value set in the `Generator Demand Limit Scheme Purchased Electric Demand Limit` field, which was chosen as the optimization variable. This value was set to 206.1 kW as an initial estimate to maximize demand reduction by reducing peak demand during the month with the lowest utility demand (271.1 kW in September) by the generator's `Maximum Full Load Electrical Power Output` (65 kW), as shown in the object below and Figure x.

The annual energy use intensity and energy cost savings for the optimized demand limit of 239.65 kW is shown in Figures x. and x. below, which showed a savings of -6.9% and 9.2% respectively. This measure saved demand costs at the expense of increased natural gas cost and consumption, which shows up under the Generators end use in EnergyPlus.

## 3.8 Advanced Sensors and Controls (lighting) (C1)

The pre-optimization process for this technology focused on two continuous variables; the `Minimum Limit Duration`, which is the minimum amount of time in minutes that the lighting power is reduced during demand limiting, and the `Maximum Limit Fraction`, which is the fractional limit of full load lighting power reduction where 1.0 indicates no reduction. The `Maximum Limit Fraction` was fixed at 0.85 based on California's 2016 energy standard, which requires that all buildings greater than 929 m2 (10,000 ft2) be capable of automatically reducing total lighting power by at least 15% in response to a signal from the grid. 

For the optimization, the demand limit duration was simulated at fixed durations to determine the sensitivity of the results. The results showed very small changes in annual energy of about 1.00 USD with durations of 10 minutes to 320 minutes as shown in Figure x.

## 3.9 Smart Thermostats (C2)

The optimization process for this measure used the Baseline Perturbation analysis option in PAT, which allows discrete values of independent variables to be explored parametrically. For this analysis, the `Maximum Heating Setpoint Reset` and the `Maximum Cooling Setpoint Reset` were optimized to reduce the total annual utility cost by changing the reset temperature by 0.5C increments between the occupied and unoccupied setpoints as summarized in the table x. and x. below. These two independent variables were optimized separately because there is limited interaction between the heating setpoint and cooling setpoint, which also reduced computation time significantly.

__Table x. Maximum Heating Setpoint Reset Temperatures__

Heating Setpoint | Setpoint (C)
:- | :-
Occupied | 21
Discrete Values | 20.5
. | 20
. | 19.5
. | 19
. | 18.5
. | 18
. | 17.5
. | 17
. | 16.5
. | 16
Unoccupied | 15.6

__Table x. Maximum Cooling Setpoint Reset Temperatures__

Cooling Setpoint | Setpoint (C)
:- | :-
Occupied | 24
Discrete Values | 24.5
. | 25
. | 25.5
. | 26
. | 26.5
Unoccupied | 26.7

As expected, greater reset temperatures produced more utility cost savings such that the highest savings occurred with resets that were at or near the unoccupied setpoint temperatures. For heating, the highest cost savings occurred with a reset temperature of 16C, close to the unoccupied setpoint of 15.7C as shown in Figure x. For Cooling, the hightest cost savings occurred with a reset temperature of 26.7C, the unoccupied setpoint as shown in Figure x. The annual energy cost and use savings for the combination of these reset temperatures is shown in Figures x. and x. below, which was 25.0% and 11.5% respectively.

# 5. Conclusions

This report built upon the work of the author that identified ten mature market-ready technologies suitable for GEBs that could also be evaluated with BPS software by quantifying the potential of nine technologies to provide grid services such as energy efficiency, load shedding, and load shifting. The methodology leveraged OpenStudio software tools to develop computer scripts known as Measures for each technology that could be widely applied to OpenStudio models. The analysis used the Medium Office Commercial Reference Building Model as a baseline for evaluating the potential of each technology for providing grid services by optimizing each Measure in OpenStudio's Parametric Analysis Tool to minimize the annual energy cost. Energy cost was chosen as a reasonable metric for determining the grid-interactive benefits of a technology because it includes the effects of both energy efficiency and demand when the utility tariffs include separate charges for consumption and demand. This approach assumes that the utility structures their rate tariffs to reduce the burden on their infrastructure and avoids the need for computationally intensive post processing of hourly or sub-hourly simulation results to determine changes in energy demand. The analysis focused on intra-optimization of each technology by identifying a single independent variable to optimize (where possible), instead of a large scale inter-optimization across all technologies, which significantly reduced the optimization problem and computation requirements. 

Future work should focus on developing a suite of generic Measures that can be applied to building models, developing a workflow for inter-optimization of multiple technologies, and enhancing BPS software such as EnergyPlus to include GEB technologies and reporting capabilities. In particular, improved reporting that easily and readily presents both the time and value of peak demand for both the building and the utility would allow users to evaluate the potential of technologies to provide grid services such as load shedding and load shifting in more detail.
